# A Minecraft Mod with Fabric

## About the Lanthanum Mod

Welcome to the Lanthanum Mod! This mod is inspired by my fondness for the Chinese character "镧" (Lanthanum).

### Why Create This Mod?

I created this mod simply because I have an affection for the Chinese character "镧." <br/>
I'm not sure if there are others who share the same interest, but if you appreciate it, you are welcome to use this mod.<br/>
Even if you have no particular attachment to this character, you are still welcome to use this mod; I don't mind.<br/>
For your reference, "镧" is a chemical element with the symbol La and atomic number 57.<br/>
"澜" is a character in the game called "Arena of Valor."

### Our Goals

Our goal is to provide you with a unique gaming experience in Minecraft while paying homage to fascinating elements of Chinese culture. We will continually strive to enhance and expand this mod to offer more exciting content and features.

Thank you for your support and for using the Lanthanum Mod!
